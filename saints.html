      <h2>John the Evangelist</h2>
      <p>John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the supposed author of the Gospel of John.

Here to the left John the Evangelist is depicted with a nimbus circling his head and two sunflowers crossed above. The sunflowers are emblematic of the sun's power and life-giving force. To the right John the Evangelist is depicted with the head of an eagle, an oft associated animal symbol of John.</p>

      <h2>Saint Denis of Paris</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Italy in the 3rd century AD, Denis was sent as a missionary to Gaul by Pope St. Clement. Denis made the base of his missionary activity in what is today Paris and for this reason is now known as the first bishop of Paris and the Apostle of France. Denis and his priestly companions were arrested and imprisoned for their missionary work. Denis was beheaded and it is said that afterwards he picked his mitred head up and walked for several miles, preaching a sermon along the way. The site where Denis stopped preaching and died was marked by a shrine that eventually developed into the Basilica of Saint-Denis, which became the burial place for the monarchs of France.</p>
