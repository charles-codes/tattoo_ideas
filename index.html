      <h2>Saint Denis of Paris</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Italy in the 3rd century AD, Denis was sent as a missionary to Gaul by Pope St. Clement. Denis made the base of his missionary activity in what is today Paris and for this reason is now known as the first bishop of Paris and the Apostle of France. Denis and his priestly companions were arrested and imprisoned for their missionary work. Denis was beheaded and it is said that afterwards he picked his mitred head up and walked for several miles, preaching a sermon along the way. The site where Denis stopped preaching and died was marked by a shrine that eventually developed into the Basilica of Saint-Denis, which became the burial place for the monarchs of France.</p>

      <h2>Crane of Classical Heraldry</h2>
      <p>As a symbol of heraldry the sole crane holding a stone was used to symbolize vigilance. Legend said that cranes lived along the banks of the Nile river and were preyed upon by Pygmees. To protect themselves at night, flocks of crane would charge one bird to watch duty, and that trusted bird would hold a stone in its claws so if the bird were to neglect their duties and fall asleep, it would drop the stone, thus awakening the other birds.</p>
